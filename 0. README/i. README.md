# 0. README
My name is Jordan Green. This README serves as a work-in-progress [[MOC]] for the knowledge base I curate on a daily basis.  Any time you want to come back to this overview, click my name in the top left of your screen.

## 1. Contact
 ![[1. Contact]]

## 2. Projects
This section contains [[Content Maps]] and [[Kanban]] boards to support an [[agile workflow]], with [[OKR]] based cards for [[user stories]] which are used to generate [[Tasks]] and [[Fleeting Notes]]. Tasks get automatically organized into [[Daily Task Dashboards]] for review of [[KPIs]]. Fleeting Notes get automatically sorted into folders below for further research and referencing.

## 3. Notes
[[Notes will be timestamped]] and reviewed periodically. Fleeting notes are quick, stream-of-conscious bullet notes. After further research and review, they become [[Literature Notes]]. Key literature notes get organized into a Project MOC.

## 4. Timeline
Daily Task Dashboards get moved to the Archive folder after two days. I perform a SWOT analysis weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. These get organized into their respective folders for a chronological overview.

## 5. Templates
Templates used to help generate notes quickly.
